               My Mechanical Engineering senior design project was to create an interior windshield cleaner that allowed the user an extended reach with a towel or rag. We were tasked with creating a prototype for a real product to be sold online and in stores. I took the lead on the portion of the product dedicated to holding the rag. 
               It was a challenge to brainstorm methods of securing the rag, and I eventually decided to use grommets. 
               The most difficult part was creating the grommets' shape and thickness, as well as finding a material for the entire part that was injection-moldable, flexible enough to bend comfortably for the user, but not too flexible that the part would either break or fail to provide enough pressure to the surface being cleaned.
               I also contributed to the team's material search for the rod, which was a very important ergonomics decision.

               In this project, my team was tasked with undergoing a complete design process for creating a delivery drone, which included expert interviews, industry research, and multiple steps of ideation.
               I was responsible for designing the physical drone model in CAD. 
               This was an extensive design, including 2 subassemblies and 30 custom parts. 
               The structure was successful, as the drone was easy to manufacture, balanced, and robust enough that it survived many collisions during the testing and calibration of the motors.

               This was a project for my Robot Mechanism Design course in which we had to create a mechanism driven by a servo motor.
               My partner and I decided to create a robot that would push itself forward with ski-like legs.
               I was responsible for the overall structure, CAD design, and manufacturing of the robot.
